## Usage

2.  Add the YouTube video URLs and the desired time ranges to the `videos.txt` file. The format for each line should be:
    ```
    <youtube_url>,<start_time>,<end_time>
    ```

    ```
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ,00:00:30,00:01:00

    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
4.  The audio segments will be downloaded and saved in the same directory with filenames formatted as `<video_id>_<start_time>_<end_time>.mp3`.
